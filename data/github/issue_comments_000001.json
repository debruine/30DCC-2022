I’m busy marking dissertations, but I’ll have a look at your pull request next week and will definitely incorporate that into fun and add you to the contributors list :)\n\nIn the DESCRIPTION file, you’ll see that broom.mixed and ggextra are listed under Suggests, not Imports. I only use them in vignettes or examples, so they’re not required for the package functions to run and aren’t automatically imported. But Check runs the vignettes and examples, so will need them.\n\nCheers,\nLisa\n\n\n> On 23 Apr 2021, at 11:15, Julien Colomb ***@***.***> wrote:\n> \n> \n> hi, I am not a package maker, please accept my apologies if the question is stupid.\n> \n> I clone my fork of the package in Rstudio, install it via Rstudio button and push the check button, it failed asking for broom.mixed and ggExtra packages (that was the master branch, not the one with my changes). Once I installed the package, it runs smoothly and gives no error.\n> \n> I thought the dependencies would be installed with devtools::load_all(\".\"), did I do something strange or are the dependencies of check different from the dependencies of the package, or ??\n> \n> —\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/debruine/faux/issues/75>, or unsubscribe <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ADRMXP7YGBV7IC5ZWYPCXU3TKFCCVANCNFSM43OLFVRQ>.\n> \n\n",

    "body": "When I ran your code, cmat is a tibble that looks like a correlation matrix. If you want to use the full matrix specification, you need to convert this to a matrix with `as.matrix()`.\r\n\r\nHowever, it also isn't symmetric (e.g. the correlation between q_sxs_corr_1 and q_sxs_corr_2 in the upper right triangle isn't the same at the correlation between q_sxs_corr_2 and q_sxs_corr_1 in the lower left triangle). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you're simulating correlations among the 21 items sampled from a uniform distribution between .25 and .8. That almost certainly means that the pattern of correlations you're creating will be literally impossible (i.e., not positive definite). For example, `rnorm_multi(n=100, vars=3, r=c(.25, .8, -.5))` returns an error that the correlation matrix is not positive definite because if A and B correlate .25, and A and C correlate .8, then B and C can only have correlations between -0.38 and +0.78 (see `faux::pos_def_limits(.25, .8, NA)`).\r\n\r\nWith such a large number of intercorrelations, you need to either set all of the values to a smaller random range or use real data (which should have an achievable pattern of correlations).\r\n\r\nI can get the following to work (also fixes the asymmetric tibble problem and reduces the questionnaire item correlation range):\r\n\r\n```\r\nGenRow <- function(iter) {\r\n  row_without_diag <- c(\r\n    # Questionnaire items\r\n    runif(21, .25, .5), # reduced 0.8 to 0.5\r\n    # Other variable\r\n    runif(1, -.43, -.17)\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  row_without_diag[(iter+1):22]. # just return upper right triangle part\r\n}\r\n\r\nurtri <- lapply(1:21, function(x) GenRow(x)) %>% unlist()\r\n\r\n# convert upper right triangle to full matrix\r\n# not necessary, as the r argument will also take the URT vector, \r\n# but useful for checking what a symmetric matrix looks like\r\ncmat <- faux:::cormat_from_triangle(urtri)\r\n\r\ndat <- rnorm_multi(n=100, vars=22, r=cmat, varnames = LETTERS[1:22])\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

I had realized the non-symmetry and generally that I'd need to put some thought into creating positive definite matrices, but that helps to see how to use `pos_def_limits` and `cormat_from_triangle` (given that it's not always desirable to use an empirical correlation matrix as I ended up doing in this case).

Test y is a novel test, which hasn't been used yet, and we know nothing about it.\r\n- Both tests are administered at times 1 and 2, six months apart, to the same sample of 40 participants.\r\n\r\nDifference scores:  \r\n\r\n- I expect that test x will yield higher scores at time 2 because participants will undergo medical treatment. I don't know how large the improvement will be. Qualitatively, clinicians say that it will be \"very large.\"\r\n- If test y works correctly, it will also yield higher scores at time 2.\r\n\r\nThe study objective is to check whether improvements measured by test x correlate with improvements measured by test y.\r\n\r\nThe study hasn't started yet. I want to analyze how much power I will have given the sample size, different potential effect sizes, and different properties of test y, which we know nothing about.
