I've used JPsychoMorph in our lab for years, so naturally I was/am excited to try this version.\r\n\r\nI am trying to setup an instance of webmorph on my local machine (macOS Mojave) and ran into a bit of an issue. I followed the instructions on your README and everything appeared to work, but when I go to `webmorph.test` or `localhost` my browser takes me to a webpage that simply states \"It works!\". When I add `:8080` it takes me to the tomcat webpage stating it was successfully installed. I'm not a web developer, so this is fairly new to me. I'm just curious if I overlooked a step, or missed something that might be an easy fix since you went though this before.\r\n\r\nI did notice that I am running an newer version of `php` than what you mention in your docs (7.x vs 5.x), though I'm not sure that should matter?",

If a file contains a plus sign in its filename during upload, the file content is depicted as empty in Webmorph (the preview also does not work). Also, after downloading it from Webmorph and opening it locally, the problem persists. \r\nIt probably has to do with plus signs in the browser being used as special characters. Therefore, when parsing file names during upload, plus signs should probably be replaced with underscores (as is already performed for whitespaces).\r\nBest regards,\r\nMario",

    "title": "question: How to simulate correlated difference scores?",
    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nFirst off — thank you for creating this package! Would you be able to answer my question about simulating correlated difference scores?\r\n\r\nTo perform power analysis, I want to simulate two sets of scores with their differences correlated. \r\n\r\nThere are two tests, x and y, administered at time points 1 and 2:\r\n- x1 and x2 are scores on test x administered at times 1 and 2, respectively\r\n- y1 and y2 are scores on test y administered at times 1 and 2, respectively\r\n\r\nGiven some arbitrary values of x1 and some correlations between:\r\n- x1 and x2,\r\n- x1 and y1,\r\n\r\nI want to simulate data where (x2 - x1) and (y2 - y1) are correlated, with the correlation equal to some corr_deltas.\r\n\r\nCould you please tell me if this is possible to do using your package and how to go about it?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n— Maciej",
