# Global Change

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("R/setup.R")
```

Much of the data over time about climate change has a scale problem. Things are pretty stable for quite a long period of time, and then there is a huge jump in the rate of change over the past 100 years. This makes things hard to plot. So today I thought I'd explore the `r pkg("ggforce")`, specifically the `facet_zoom()` function for zooming in on a particular part of a plot.


```{r}
#| code-summary: Setup

library(readxl)    # for reading excel files
library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling
library(MetBrewer) # for colour themes
library(ggforce)   # for plot zooming

theme_set(theme_bw())
```


## Data

The data come from a paper by [Matt Osman and colleagues](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03984-4). The data for their Figure 2 are freely available, but there are two datasets side-by-side on one sheet, so extracting them took a few steps.

The first dataset is global mean surface temperatures (GMST) from 24K years ago to present, in 200-year bins. The second dataset is GMST from 1000 years ago to 50 years in the future, in 10-year bins. They have some overlap, so I'll get rid of the years -1000 to present in the more coarse dataset.

```{r}
dat200 <- read_xlsx("data/41586_2021_3984_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx",
                  range = "A2:L122") %>%
  slice(-(1:5))
dat10 <- read_xlsx("data/41586_2021_3984_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx",
                  range = "N2:Y107")
```


```{r}
dat_combo <- bind_rows(dat10, dat200)

head(dat_combo)
```

Cleaning this is tricky. I want to separate on the "-", but not if it's the "- for a negative number (who chose this format?!). I get to use a regex lookbehind, which I just learned about! "(?<=0)-" means a dash that is preceded by (but not including) a 0. 

```{r}
dat <- dat_combo %>%
  separate(1, into = c("start", "end"), sep = "(?<=0)-")
```

## Initial Plot

```{r}
ggplot(dat, aes(x = start, y = `50th`)) +
  geom_point()
```

As always, the first plot leaves a bit to be desired. Mainly because I forgot to convert the type of the `start` and `end` columns when I split them. It's a quick fix with `type_convert()`. I also subtracted the start column from 2020 to calculate the year of each estimate, rather than "years before present".

```{r}
dat <- readr::type_convert(dat) %>%
  mutate(year = 2020 - start)

ggplot(dat, aes(x = year, y = `50th`)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Ribbons

```{r}
col <- MetBrewer::met.brewer("Greek", 6)
```


```{r}
ggplot(dat, aes(x = year, y = `50th`)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `5th`, ymax = `95th`), 
              fill = col[1]) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `10th`, ymax = `90th`), 
              fill = col[2]) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `20th`, ymax = `80th`), 
              fill = col[3]) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `30th`, ymax = `70th`), 
              fill = col[4]) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `40th`, ymax = `60th`), 
              fill = col[5]) +
  geom_line(color = col[6])
```

## Facet Zoom

Now I'll use `facet_zoom()` from ggforce to highlight the years since 1990. I do wish I could figure out how to specify the two x-axes separately. I'd like the top one to label every 2000 years, and the bottom one every 20. 

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
#| fig.alt: Plot of global mean surface temperature from 22000BC to 50 years in the future. The recent rapid rise is highlighted in a zoomed out section from 1900 to 2070.

ggplot(dat, aes(x = year, y = `50th`)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `5th`, ymax = `95th`, fill = col[1])) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `10th`, ymax = `90th`, fill = col[2])) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `20th`, ymax = `80th`, fill = col[3])) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `30th`, ymax = `70th`, fill = col[4])) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `40th`, ymax = `60th`, fill = col[5])) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `50th`, ymax = `50th`, fill = col[6]), alpha = 0) +
  geom_line(color = col[6], size = 1) +
  scale_fill_identity(name = "Percentile",
                      breaks = unclass(col[1:6]),
                      labels = c("5-95%", "10-90%", "20-80%", "30-70%", "40-60%", "50%"),
                      
                      guide = "legend") +
  #scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-24000, 2000, 2000)) +
  facet_zoom(xlim = c(1900, 2070), 
             ylim = c(-0.5, 0.75),
             horizontal = FALSE, 
             zoom.size = 1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Global mean surface temperature (GMST)\n") +
  theme(legend.position = c(.81, .74),
        legend.background = element_blank())
```
