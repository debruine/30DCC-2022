# Tiles

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("R/setup.R")
```

I really love the github activity tile graphs. For today's plot, I'm going to use the data from  [Day -@sec-downup] to make a similar plot, but showing all of my contributions from when I Joined github on September 27, 2015

```{r github-activity}
knitr::include_graphics("images/github_activity.png")
```


```{r}
#| code-summary: Setup

library(tidyverse)
```
